\chapter{UNIX for Beginners}
\label{chap:unix_for_beginners}

什么是 UNIX? 从狭义上来说, 它是一个分时操作系统内核. 内核是一种计算机程序,
用于控制计算机资源, 并将其分配给用户. 有了内核, 用户就可以运行他们自己的程序;
内核控制着连接到主机上的外围设备 (磁盘, 终端, 打印机等); 内核还提供了一
个文件系统, 用于管理需要长期存放的数据, 比如程序, 文档.

从广义上来说, 除了内核, UNIX 还必须包含一系列必要的应用程序, 比如编译器, 编辑
器, 命令语言, 文件复制与打印程序等.

再说得宽泛些, UNIX 甚至还可以包括由用户自己开发的, 可以在系统中运行的程序,
比如文档展示工具, 统计分析工具, 和图形图像软件包等.

如何恰当地使用这些 UNIX 概念, 取决于读者所考虑的系统层面. 在本书中, 当我们提到
UNIX 时, 其上下文语境足以指明它的具体含义.

有时候, UNIX 系统可能比看起来更加难以使用 --- 初学者很难知道如何以最高的效率
使用 UNIX. 但幸运的是, 入门并不是很困难 --- 通过对几个简单的工具的了解, 读者
就可以马上开始使用 UNIX 系统. 这一章的目标是帮助读者尽可能快得开始使用 UNIX.
本章只是一个概览, 而非手册, 我们会在后面的章节再详细地介绍本章提到的大部分内
容. 本章介绍的内容有:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 基础 --- 登录与注销, 简单的命令, 纠正打字错误, 邮件, 终端间通信.

如果读者曾经使用过 UNIX 系统, 那么本章的大部分内容都会感到很熟悉, 此时读者可
以直接从第 2 章开始阅读.

You will need a copy of the \textit{UNIX Programmer's Manual}, even as you read
this chapter; it's often easier for us to tell you to read about something in
the manual than to repeat its contents here. This book is not supposed to
replace it, but to show you how to make best use of the commands described in
it. Furthermore, there may be differences between what we say here and what is
true on your system. The manual has a permuted index at the beginning that's
indispensable for finding the right programs to apply to a problem; learn to use
it.

Finally, a word of advice: don't be afraid to experiment. If you are a beginner,
there are very few accidental things you can do to hurt yourself or other
users. So learn how things work by trying them. This is a long chapter, and the
best way to read it is a few pages at a time, trying things out as you go.


\section{Getting Started}
\subsection{Some prerequisites about terminals and typing}

To avoid explaining everything about using computers, we must assume you have
some familiarity with computer terminals and how to use them. If any of the
following statements are mystifying, you should ask a local expert for help.

The UNIX system is \textit{full duplex}: the characters you type on the keyboard
are sent to the system, which sends them back to the terminal to be printed on
the screen. Normally, this \textit{echo} process copies the characters directly
to the screen, so you can see what you are typing, but sometimes, such as when
you are typing a secret password, the echo is turned off so the characters do
not appear on the screen.

Most of the keyboard characters are ordinary printing characters with no special
significance, but a few tell the computer how to interpret your typing. By far
the most important of these is the RETURN key. The RETURN key signifies the end
of a line of input; the system echoes it by moving the terminal's cursor to the
beginning of the next line on the screen. RETURN must be pressed before the
system will interpret the characters you have types.

RETURN is an example of a \textit{control character} --- an invisible character
that controls some aspect of input and output on the terminal. On any reasonable
terminal, RETURN has a key of its own, but most control characters do
not. Instead, they must be typed by holding down the CONTROL key, sometimes
called CTL or CNTL or CTRL, then pressing another key, usually a letter. For
example, RETURN may be typed by pressing the RETURN key or, equivalently,
holding down the CONTROL key and typing an `m'. RETURN might therefore be called
a control-m, which we will write as \textit{ctl}-m. Other control characters
include \textit{ctl}-d, which tells a program that there is no more input;
\textit{ctl}-g, which rings the bell on the terminal; \textit{ctl}-h, often
called backspace, which can be used to correct typing mistakes; and
\textit{ctl}-i, often called tab, which advances the cursor to the next tab
stop, much as on a regular typewriter. Tab stops on UNIX systems are eight
spaces apart. Both the backspaces and tab characters have their keys on the
terminals.

Two other keys have special meaning: DELETE, sometimes called RUBOUT or some
abbreviation, and BREAK, sometimes called INTERRUPT. On most UNIX systems, the
DELETE key stops a program immediately, without waiting for it to finish. On
some systems, \textit{ctl}-c provides this device. And on some systems,
depending on how the terminals are connected, BREAK is synonym for DELETE or
\textit{ctl}-c.


\subsection{A Session with UNIX}

Let's begin with an annotated dialog between you and your UNIX system.
Throughout the examples in this book, what you type is printed in slanted
letters, computer responses are in typewriter-style characters, and explanations
are in \textit{italics}.

\begin{verbatim}
        Establish a connection: dial a phone or turn on a switch as necessary.
        Your system should say
        login: you                 Type your name, then press RETURN
        Password:                  Your password won't be echoed as you type it
        You have mail.             There's mail to be read after you log in
        $                          The system is now ready for your commands
        $                          Press RETURN a couple of times
        $ date                     What is the date and time?
        Sun Sep 25 23:02:57 EDT 1983
        $ who                      Who's using the computer?
        jlb      ttyO    Sep 25 13:59
        you      tty2    Sep 25 23:01
        mary     tty4    Sep 25 19:03
        doug     tty5    Sep 25 19:22
        egb      tty7    Sep 25 17:17
        bob      tty8    Sep 25 20:48
        $ mail                     Read your mail
        From doug Sun Sep 25 20:53 EDT 1983
        give me a call sometime monday

        ?                          RETURN moves on to the next message
        From mary Sun Sep 25 19:07 EDT 1983     Next message

        ? d                        Delete this message
        $                          No more mail
        $ mail mary                Send mail to mary
        lunch at 12 is fine
        ctl-d                      End of mail
        $                          Hang up phone or turn off terminal
                                   and that's the end
\end{verbatim}
Sometimes that's all there is to a session, though occasionally people do some
work too. The rest of this section will discuss the session above, plus other
programs that make it possible to do useful things.


\subsection{Logging in}

You must have a login name and password, which you can get from your system
administrator. The UNIX system is capable of dealing wit a wide variety of
terminals, but it is strongly oriented towards devices with lower case; case
distinctions matter! If your terminal produces only upper case (like some video
and portable terminals), life will be so difficult that you should look for
another terminal.

Be sure the switches are set appropriately on your device: upper and lower case,
full duplex, and any other settings that local experts advise, such as the
speed, or \textit{baud rate}. Establish a connection using whatever magic is
needed for your terminal; this may involve dialing a telephone or merely
flipping a switch. In either case, the system should type
\begin{verbatim}
        login:
\end{verbatim}
If it types garbage, you may be at the wrong speed; check the speed setting and
other switches. If that fails, press the BREAK or INTERRUPT key a few times,
slowly. If nothing produces a login message, you will have to get help.

When you get the \verb=login:= message, type your login name \textit{in lower
  case}. Follow it by pressing RETURN. If a password is required, you will be
asked for it, and printing will be turned off while you type it.

The culmination of your login efforts is a \textit{prompt}, usually a single
character, indicating that the system is ready to accept commands from you. The
prompt is mostly likely to be a dollar sign \verb=$= or a percent sign \verb=%=,
but you can change it to anything you like; we'll show you how a little
later. The prompt is actually printed by a program called the \textit{command
  interpreter} or \textit{shell}, which is your main interface to the system.

There may be a message of the day just before the prompt, or a notification that
you have mail. You may also be asked what kind of terminal you are using; your
answer helps the system to use any special properties the terminal might have.


\subsection{Typing commands}

Once you receive the prompt, you can type commands, which are requests that the
system do something. We will use \textit{program} as a synonym for
\textit{command}. When you see the prompt (let's assume it's \verb=$=), type
date and press RETURN. the system should replay with the date and time, then
print another prompt, so the whole transaction will look like this on your
terminal:
\begin{verbatim}
        $ date
        Mon Sep 26 12:20:57 EDT 1983
        $
\end{verbatim}
Don't forget RETURN, and don't type the \verb=$=. If you think you're being
ignored, press RETURN; something should happen. RETURN won't be mentioned again,
but you need it at the end of every line.

The next command to try is who, which tells you everyone who is currently logged
in:
\begin{verbatim}
        $ who
        rim     tty0     Sep 26 11:37
        pjw     tty4     Sep 26 11:30
        gerard  tty7     Sep 26 10:27
        mark    tty9     Sep 26 07:59
        you     ttya     Sep 26 12:20
        $
\end{verbatim}
The first column is the user name. The second is the system's name for the
connection being used (``tty'' stands for ``teletype,'' an archaic synonym for
``terminal''). The rest tells when the user logged on. You might also try
\begin{verbatim}
        $ who am i
        you     ttya     Sep 26 12:20
        $
\end{verbatim}

If you make a mistake typing the name of a command, and refer to a non-existent
command, you will be told that no command of that name can be found:
\begin{verbatim}
        $ whom                     Misspelled command name ...    
        whom: not found            ... so system didn't know how to run it
        $
\end{verbatim}
Of course, if you inadvertently type the name of an actual command, it will run,
perhaps with mysterious results.


\subsection{Strange terminal behavior}

Sometimes your terminal will act strangely, for example, each letter may be
typed twice, or RETURN may not put the cursor at the first column of the next
line. You can usually fix this by turning the terminal off and on, or by logging
out and logging back in. Or you can read the description of the command
\texttt{stty} (``set terminal options'') in Section 1 of the manual. To get
intelligent treatment of tab characters if your terminal doesn't have tabs, type
the command
\begin{verbatim}
        $ stty -tabs
\end{verbatim}
and the system will convert tabs into the right number of spaces. If your
terminal does have computer-settable tab stops, the command tabs will set them
correctly for you. (You may actually have to say
\begin{verbatim}
        $ tabs terminal-type
\end{verbatim}
to make it work --- see the \texttt{tabs} command description in the manual.)
